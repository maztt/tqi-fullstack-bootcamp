# tqi-fullstack-bootcamp

This repository will contain projects/challenges I develop throughout the bootcamp @ DIGITAL INNOVATION ONE.

### more:

Being a rookie in this devworld is in fact bringing me a lot of fun, I always liked seeing the output of the stuff I come up with but sharing them actually takes a lot of effort from me, so I also have been taking the experiences as growth to my mindset.

As the first bootcamp I get the opportunity to be in, I'll be looking to keep this repository eventually updated with the progress I make so at the end we can take a good look at everything and think about how the effort we put in this kind of stuff is indeed profitable.

Feel free to visit the stuff around here and reach me out for suggestions or tips and tricks.
